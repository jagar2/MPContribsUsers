description:
We have measured thermodynamic data of perovskites ABO3-δ , i.e. ΔH and ΔS in
dependence of the non-stoichiometry δ by means of thermogravimetric analysis.
That means, we measured the mass changes in dependence of T and p(O2),
determined the corresponding non-stoichiometry changes and used this data to
extract thermodynamic properties from van’t Hoff plots. [t=1.006]
